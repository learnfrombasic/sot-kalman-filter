## Roadmap

This project has significant potential for expansion. Here's a roadmap outlining potential features and improvements, categorized by complexity:

**Phase 1: Core Improvements (Next 1-2 Months)**

*   **Robust Detection Integration:** Integrate with more sophisticated object detectors (e.g., YOLO, SSD) for improved detection accuracy and robustness.
*   **Data Association:** Implement a data association algorithm (e.g., Hungarian algorithm, Nearest Neighbor) to handle situations where the detector provides multiple detections. This is crucial for handling occlusions and noisy detections.
*   **Adaptive Noise Covariances:** Implement adaptive noise covariance estimation to dynamically adjust the process and measurement noise based on the tracking performance.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Implement standard SOT performance metrics (e.g., Precision, Recall, MOTA, MOTP) for quantitative evaluation.

**Phase 2: Advanced Tracking Techniques (Next 3-6 Months)**

*   **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) / Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF):** Explore and implement EKFs or UKFs to handle non-linear process or measurement models. This is important if the object's motion is not linear.
*   **Occlusion Handling:** Develop more sophisticated occlusion handling techniques, such as prediction-based tracking during occlusions or re-identification after an occlusion ends.
*   **Appearance Modeling:** Incorporate appearance features (e.g., color histograms, HOG features) into the measurement model to improve tracking robustness to similar-looking objects.
*   **Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) Extension:**  Extend the framework to handle multiple objects simultaneously.

**Phase 3: Optimization and Deployment (Long-Term)**

*   **Optimization:** Optimize the code for performance, potentially using techniques like vectorization or GPU acceleration.
*   **Real-Time Performance:**  Focus on achieving real-time tracking performance for practical applications.
*   **Deployment:**  Explore deployment options, such as integrating the tracker into a robotic system or a video surveillance application.
*   **Dataset Integration:**  Integrate with standard SOT/MOT datasets (e.g., VOT, MOTChallenge) for benchmarking and comparison.

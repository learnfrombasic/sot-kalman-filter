# sot-kalman-filter

## Overview

This repository focuses on implementing and evaluating a **Kalman Filter for Single Object Tracking (SOT)**. It provides a framework for tracking a single object across a video sequence using the Kalman Filter algorithm. 

The core purpose of this project is to explore and refine Kalman Filter-based tracking, including state definition, process and measurement models, and performance evaluation. It serves as a practical learning and experimentation platform for SOT using Kalman Filtering.

## Features

*   **Basic Kalman Filter Implementation:** A foundational implementation of the Kalman Filter for tracking.
*   **State Definition:**  Configurable state vector (e.g., position, velocity).
*   **Process and Measurement Models:**  Definable process and measurement noise covariances.
*   **Simple Object Detection Integration:**  Currently integrates with [mention your detection method, e.g., a simple bounding box detector or a pre-trained model].
*   **Visualization:**  Basic visualization of the tracked object and its predicted trajectory.
